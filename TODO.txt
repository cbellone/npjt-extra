TODO
====

- Support external file for queries : yeah, multiline queries in java code is not fun

- @AutoGeneratedKey has some shortcoming:
	- no automatic type conversion with the current infrastructure of ColumnMapper
	- single field name for all DB
	
- expose the mapping infrastructure to a custom subclass of the rowmapper
	
- Write a nice README :)
